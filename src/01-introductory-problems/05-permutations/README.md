A permutation of integers $1,2,\ldots,n$ is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is $1$.

Given $n$, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

## Input
The only input line contains an integer $n$.

## Output
Print a beautiful permutation of integers $1,2,\ldots,n$. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

## Constraints
- $1 \le n \le 10^6$

## Example 1
