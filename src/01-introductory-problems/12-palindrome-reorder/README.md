Given a string, your task is to reorder its letters in such a way that it becomes a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).

## Input
The only input line has a string of length $n$ consisting of characters `A–Z`.

## Output
Print a palindrome consisting of the characters of the original string. You may print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

## Constraints
- $1 \le n \le 10^6$

## Example
Input:
```plain
AAAACACBA
```

Output:
```plain
AACABACAA
```
